# tortoise.cpp: GGML implementation of tortoise-tts (Ready for testing!)

![a menacing sea turtle in the ocean; mascot for tortoise.cpp](https://github.com/balisujohn/tortoise.cpp/blob/master/assets/tortoiselogo.png?raw=true)

# Downloading
clone the repository with the following command
````
git clone --recursive git@github.com:balisujohn/tortoise.cpp.git
````
# Compiling
For now, CUDA and CPU only. To compile:

## Compile for CPU
````
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. 
make
````

## Compile for CUDA
````
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DGGML_CUBLAS=ON
make
````
This is tested with Ubuntu 22.04 and cuda 12.0 and a 1070ti

# Running
You will need to place `ggml-model.bin`, `ggml-vocoder-model.bin` and `ggml-diffusion-model.bin` in the models directory to run tortoise.cpp. You can download them here https://huggingface.co/balisujohn/tortoise-ggml. I will release scripts for generating these files from tortoise-tts.

From the build directory, run:
````
./tortoise
````
here's an example that should work out of the box:
````
./tortoise --message "based... dr freeman?" --voice "../models/mouse.bin" --seed 0 --output "based?.wav"
````
all command line arguments are optional:

````
arguments:
  --message           Specifies the message to generate, lowercase letters, spaces, and punctuation only. (default: "this is a test message." )
  --voice             Specifies the path to the voice file to use to determine the speaker's voice.  (default: "../models/mol.bin" )
  --output            Specifies the path where the generated wav file will be saved.                 (default: "./output.wav")
  --seed              Specifies the seed for psuedorandom number generation, used in autoregressive sampling and diffusion sampling (default: system time seed)

# How to add voices

set up the original tortoise-tts, then run it with whatever voice you have, then after this line:
https://github.com/neonbjb/tortoise-tts/blob/e2d9fba0bb5c4376d0d142efea47a448f97c4d90/tortoise/api.py#L401

add this code:
````
numpy_array = auto_conditioning.to("cpu").numpy().astype(np.float32)  # Ensure float32 for binary format

# Define the file path
file_path = 'auto_conditioning.bin'

# Save NumPy array as binary file
numpy_array.tofile(file_path)

print("saved auto conditioning")
exit()
````
then you can rename `auto_conditioning.bin` to the speaker name and put the file in your models folder to use it like any other voice. This works with voices clone with `tortoise-tts`.

# Contributing
If you want to contribute, please make an issue stating what you want to work on. DM me on twitter if you want a link to join the dev Discord, or if you have questions. I am happy to help get people get started with contributing!

I am also making available a fork of tortoise-tts which has my reverse engineering annotations, and also the export script for the autoregressive model.
